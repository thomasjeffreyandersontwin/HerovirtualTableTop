I am trying to hack into the following application http://paragonwiki.com/wiki/Titan_Icon, info / hints can be found at http://www.cohtitan.com/forum/index.php?board=174.0. One topic of note > http://www.cohtitan.com/forum/index.php/topic,11356.0.html

I want to be able to...

1) fire a power in any direction
-- in COH type /spawn_npc model_statesman test > a toon loads
-- type /loadcostume Spyder_Rune > a costume appears on the toon (costumes must be located in COH\costumes)
-- type /loadcostume Spyder_Rune_Blast.fx > a new costume loads, one with a power in it, the "power" fires in specific direction, towards 0,0,0 on the map
-- type/editpos > you can see the coordinates of the toon in x,y.z

Question > what memory variable / function, etc can change the destination of the power being fired? Want to be able to fire powers in any direction

2) retrieve info of target character that cursor is hovering over
-- I have found out how to access the name and pos of a targeted character ( I can share the code)
> pointer to target Memory Address:=0x00F14FB0 
> name  := pointer to target Memory Address + 12740 (needs to be converted to hex)
> x,y,z := pointer to target Memory Address + 92,96,100 (needs to be converted to hex)

Question > how do i get the details for the character the mouse is hovering over (this causes the name of te character to popp up so the software must know)

3) Modify In Game menu
-- The COH game comes with a number of menues / dialogue boxes. Key are Combat Attributes, Incarnate Abilitites, Powers Tray, + custom, main menu, targeted character, and chat. Each dialogue has trays, options, etx
> is there a way to hack into COH to...
> remove powers in trays
> add powers to trays (can do macros already) looking for actual powers with pictures
> change groupings, grouping titles, powers in groupings, specifiy "automatic" powers
> use different images for powers
> choose what is highlighted and what isnt
> change what is displayed on tooltips
> capture when button, power, etc is clicked, expanded, etc...

4) Dynamically load Pop up menu
-- load a popup menu into Icon (place into COH\data\texts\English\Menus) and relaunch COH
-- change a menu item and activate pop up, menu does not change
> figure out way to reload contents of popmenu on demand

5)Get the x,y,z boundaries of walls, floors, and ceilings on the map
-- currently the camera/ main character respects boundaries on the map ie cannot move through floors and walls on the map
-- the only way to move toons is to dynamically change x,y,z in memory
-- is there a way of getting coordinates / boundaries of building/floor from memory, that way I can program collision detection

6) Changing direction
-- currently rotation of a targeted character is captured using a rotation matrix at pointer to target Memory Address (0x00F14FB0) + 56, 64,80,	88
> what is the function that converts the question "turn left 5 degrees" into the right numbers to plug into the matrix (my 3d math sucks)

7)launching key binds
-- currently the only way to execute an action in icon is through 
> typing in a keybind in the command line eg: /spawn_npc model_statesman test
> loading a keybind file that binds a keystroke eg:/bind_load data\custom_keybinds.txt (with "B /spawn_npc model_statesman test" in the file) and press the appropriate key
-- Is there a way to invoke keybind commands directly from memory? key commands are at http://paragonwiki.com/wiki/Titan_Icon
